Make Across the World Cruises responsive
Create styles for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens
using a mobile first approach.

Exercise 1
1. In index.html, add a meta tag to stop browser scaling
2. * In style.css, change the width of main to 100%

Exercise 2
1. Open index.html and launch with Live Server
Open in the code inspector and turn on the device toolbar
Change the width of screen
Note the screen width when the divs rearrange from 3 columns into 2, 
and from 2 columns into 1
These will be your breakpoints

Exercise 3
1. Create 2 media queries for the tablet and desktop breakpoints
2. Examine the screenshots to see the styles for:
mobile
tablet
desktop
The shape of the divs and the page background image are different
3. Write the styles for mobile first. 
Make the page title smaller
Make the divs into a square shape, and add the border
Keep an eye on the background-size property and make sure the background images fill the rectangular divs

4. Write the styles for tablet and desktop in the media queries
Make the divs display as circles
If borders were added in mobile and tablet, remove them for dektop, etc.
Hint: For desktop, remember to resize main to 1120px to keep the divs at 3 per row maximum.
